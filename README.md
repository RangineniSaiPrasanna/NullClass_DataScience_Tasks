**Null Class — Data Science Internship Project**

**Project Overview**

This project was developed during my Data Science internship and focuses on building a text-to-image generation pipeline. It involves tokenizing and encoding text with pre-trained language models, exploring multimodal datasets, fine-tuning advanced generative models, and improving GANs with attention mechanisms for better image quality.

**Features**

1.Text tokenization and encoding using BERT and GPT

2.Analysis and visualization of datasets like COCO and Oxford-102 Flowers

3.Preprocessing text with Hugging Face Transformers

4.Fine-tuning DALL·E and Stable Diffusion models on custom data

5.Implementing self-attention and cross-attention in GANs

**Installation**

Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

-Run preprocessing scripts to prepare datasets.

-Use training scripts to fine-tune models.

-Evaluate and generate images with evaluation scripts.

-Explore notebooks for detailed analysis and visualization.

**Results**

-Developed an end-to-end pipeline for generating images from text descriptions using state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

-Achieved effective fine-tuning of DALL·E and Stable Diffusion models on custom datasets, resulting in visually coherent and domain-specific images.

-Improved image quality and semantic relevance by integrating self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms within GAN architectures.

-Demonstrated strong alignment between input text and generated images, validated through qualitative visual assessments and quantitative metrics.

-Gained valuable insights into optimizing model training and handling complex multimodal datasets efficiently.
